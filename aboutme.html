	<p>Hello! My name is Shunhua Fu, and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
	Colloquially, I just go by Sam. I am into trying out new things and being spontaneous. In my free time, I like to run and play tennis, 
	as well as dance (pop and locking). I've done lots of cool things, so feel free to stay awhile and look around.</p>
	
	<p>Second paragraph huh</p>
	
	<p>Thanks for checking out my website! If you're interested, take a look at my <a href="assets/ShunhuaSamFuResume.pdf">résumé</a>.</p>
