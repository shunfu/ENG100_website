		<h2>Projects</h2>
		
		<h4>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Authentication System Consolidation</h4>
		<p>Currently, ACM's website (codename: liquid) for its many different functions requires multiple passwords--the University AD password, Korboros password, 
		and LDAP password. This is not only confusing, but also rather ineffective. As part of ACM's admin team, I am working to streamline this mess by unifying 
		all of liquid under the AD password. I am creating a django plug-in that interacts with the Crowd authentication server.</p>
	
		<h4>This Website</h4>
		<p>This is my online portfolio, which started as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project I experimented with web development 
		by coding in HTML/CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, and managed my website hosting through FTP. I also 
		implemented my own novel feature to the website by using JavaScript (jQuery). I hear fun things happen when you enter the Konami
		Code (up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-b-a). Godspeed, adventurer.</p>
	
		<h4>Android App</h4>
		<p>I am currently developing an Android app using OpenGL ES 2.0. I am visualizing a maze created through a depth-first search (DFS).</p>
	
		<h4>PairTunes</h4>
		<p>Project I hacked together with two friends for IEEE Hackathon 2013. Using RTP and sockets, we created a server-client Java application that streams 
		synchronized music between computers, meanwhile also syncing libraries and queues. We used the Java Media Framework (JMF) as well as javax.</p>
	
		<h4>PyTunes</h4>
		<p>For the ACM Hackathon, we ported PairTunes to python. We used UofI's NTP (Network Time Protocol) server to overcome issues with ping we encountered 
		while developing PairTunes. I also fiddled around with kytten, a set pyglet libraries, in order to develop a working GUI.</p>
	
		<h4>Guitar</h4>
		<p>A few years ago, I built a guitar out of scratch for the Science Olympiad event Sounds of Music. I had to cultivate my creativity and innovative 
		prowess, as well as learn the true meaning of patience. For example, I had to make many design compromises because home-made tuning pegs cannot 
		withstand the immense tension of guitar strings. I ended up fortifying and moving the pegs to the bottom of the guitar, creating a headless stock 
		guitar. We won first place in state for the event, which was very rewarding for the dozens of hours I had invested in the project.</p>
